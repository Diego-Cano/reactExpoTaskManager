# reactExpoTaskManager
 I built a Task Manager app using React Native and Expo to demonstrate how to update states with arrays and objects. For state management, I used the useState hook, which is simple and effective for handling tasks and user inputs. I made the app with a minimalist style, using calming blue colors and included a ScrollView for displaying the tasks to keep everything looking organized.

During the development, I faced challenges with ensuring that the state updates were done correctly without directly modifying the state. I also had to make sure that the task list could scroll properly when there were many tasks. By solving these issues, I learned a lot about best practices in React development, especially about keeping state updates safe and designing user-friendly interfaces.
